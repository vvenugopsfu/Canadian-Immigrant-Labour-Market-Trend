## Motivation
I as a visible minority, immigrant, and women in technology, was struggling over past few years to get a break into Canadian labour market and land a job. I am curious to study about what is happening in the job market and might help me to further investigate.

## Data Gathering
The data is sourced from Statistics Canada which produced by the Labour Statistics Division from the Labour Force Survey and the data is open to the public. The data available was in good shape and I necessarily didn’t have to perform any processing for this use case.

It was very difficult to narrow down the scope for the project which was initially to find the immigrants Labour Market Data based on sex and provincial data. It was very limited, as a result I was able to depict an overall picture of the Country.

Most of the data was readily available as well as organized properly in the Statistics Canada Website as result after collecting each data I was able to narrow down through my requirement lists and able to collect necessary data.

## Overview
Around half of Canada’s population is made up of immigrants and second-generation individuals who are non-immigrants with at least one foreign nationality parent. This analysis understands the Immigrants’ contribution to Canada’s economy and society continues and understanding the trends over the past years to learn the demographic growth

However, as pandemic emerged in 2020 as many source-countries of immigrants to Canada has dropped very badly. Hence this analysis focus on labour-market trends to understanding various aspects of their socio-economic integration using two key labour-market indicators: employment rate (Employment-toPopulation Ratio) and the unemployment rate, with references to the Canadian-born.
